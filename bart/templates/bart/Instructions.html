        <h4>Balloon Analogue Risk Task</h4>

        <p>
            In this task you will see <strong>{{ Constants.num_rounds }} balloons</strong>, one at a time.
            For each balloon, you can pump it up to earn money.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each pump adds <strong>${{ Constants.pump_value }}</strong> to your potential earnings
            for that balloon. But be careful — each pump also increases the chance
            that the balloon will <strong>pop</strong>!
        </p>

        <p>
            If the balloon pops, you lose all the money you earned for <em>that</em> balloon.
            If you click <strong>"Collect $$$"</strong> before it pops, you keep the money
            and move on to the next balloon.
        </p>

        <p>
            The balloon can pop at any point from the first pump up to pump {{ Constants.max_pumps }}.
            You won't know exactly when it will pop — the risk increases with each pump.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your total earnings are the sum of what you collect across all {{ Constants.num_rounds }} balloons.
        </p>

            <strong>Strategy tip:</strong> Balance risk and reward.
            More pumps = more potential money, but also more risk of popping!
