        <h4>Bomb Risk Elicitation Task</h4>

        <p>
            You will see a grid of <strong>{{ Constants.num_boxes }} boxes</strong> (5 &times; 5).
            One of these boxes contains a <strong>bomb</strong> — but you won't know which one!
        </p>

        <p>
            Click on boxes to collect them. Each collected box is worth
            <strong>{{ Constants.points_per_box }} points</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if you click on the box that contains the bomb,
            you lose <strong>all</strong> of your collected points for this task.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can stop collecting at any time by pressing the <strong>"Collect Points"</strong> button.
            The bomb location will then be revealed.
        </p>

        <div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #007bff; padding: 12px 16px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <strong>Strategy tip:</strong> The more boxes you open, the more points you can earn —
            but also the greater the chance you'll hit the bomb!
